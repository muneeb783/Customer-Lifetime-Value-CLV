# Customer-Lifetime-Value-CLV
The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Model is designed to estimate the total revenue a business can expect from a customer over the entire duration of their relationship. This model helps businesses make informed decisions about customer acquisition, retention, and overall strategy by predicting the long-term value of their customers.
# Features
- **Customer Segmentation:** Identifies different segments of customers based on their predicted lifetime value.
- **Revenue Prediction:** Estimates the future revenue that each customer is likely to generate.
- **Churn Prediction:** Predicts the likelihood of a customer churning (ceasing to be a customer).
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides recommendations for marketing and customer relationship management based on predicted CLV.
# Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Scikit**
- **Pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **Matplotlib**
# Data Preperation 
The model requires historical customer transaction data with the following fields:
- **InvoiceNo**
- **StockCode**
- **Quantity**
- **InvoiceDate**
- **UnitPrice**
- **CustomerID**
Although the model is designed to clean and preprocess the data before using but make sure you remove anomalies at your end and ensure that data is formatted correctly

# Evaluation
Evaluate the models perfomance after running it by using **MAE** and **MSE** values. By default they are printed at the end however, feel free to use them at your will
# Usage
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict CLV for new customers or to update predictions for existing customers based on new transaction data. Feel free to use your own dataset or pick one from Kaggle.
