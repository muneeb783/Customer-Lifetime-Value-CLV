# Customer-Lifetime-Value-CLV
The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Model is designed to estimate the total revenue a business can expect from a customer over the entire duration of their relationship. This model helps businesses make informed decisions about customer acquisition, retention, and overall strategy by predicting the long-term value of their customers.
# Features
- **Customer Segmentation:** Identifies different segments of customers based on their predicted lifetime value.
- **Revenue Prediction:** Estimates the future revenue that each customer is likely to generate.
- **Churn Prediction:** Predicts the likelihood of a customer churning (ceasing to be a customer).
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides recommendations for marketing and customer relationship management based on predicted CLV.
# Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Scikit**
- **Pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **Matplotlib**
# Data Preperation 
The model requires historical customer transaction data with the following fields:
- **InvoiceNo**
- **StockCode**
- **Quantity**
- **InvoiceDate**
- **UnitPrice**
- **CustomerID**
Although the model is designed to clean and preprocess the data before using but make sure you remove anomalies at your end and ensure that data is formatted correctly
# Evaluation
Evaluate the models perfomance after running it by using **MAE** and **MSE** values. By default they are printed at the end however, feel free to use them at your will
# Usage
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict CLV for new customers or to update predictions for existing customers based on new transaction data.
# Contributions 
Contributions to improve the model are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
